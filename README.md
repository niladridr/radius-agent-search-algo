The problem is divided in to two parts:
1. Search Properties: This algorithm runs whenever a new requirement is added to the system. Algo is in search_properties.txt.
2. Search Requirements: This algorithm runs whenever a new property is added to the system. Algo is in search_requirements.txt.

Both the algos add new records to the table Matches. To know more about the DB Schema please see DB_SCHEMA.txt.

As mentioned in the problem this algorithm is basically a pseudo code with some similarities with PHP.
